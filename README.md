- **Estimated Temperature**: `19.58Â°C`

### Visualization
- A scatter chart with original points (`8, 15; 12, 25; 16, 20; 20, 16`) and a smooth interpolated curve.

## Code Breakdown

### HTML Structure
- Contains input fields for time and temperature values.
- A button triggers the calculation, and sections display the polynomial and chart.

### CSS Styling
- Provides responsive design for desktop and mobile interfaces.
- Styles inputs, buttons, and layout.

### JavaScript Functionality
- Implements the Lagrange Interpolation method:
- Validates user input.
- Computes the polynomial and interpolated values.
- Updates the chart dynamically.

### Chart Visualization
- Uses `Chart.js` to render the scatter plot and interpolated curve for easy understanding.
